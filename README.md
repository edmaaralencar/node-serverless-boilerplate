## Get Started

- Clone repository
- Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
- Run sls deploy
- To access routes with role validation like getPresignedUrl, you have to sign up and add the user to the group `admins`.
- Keep in mind that you have to keep in sync the role from database and from AWS Cognito.
